# OctoPrint-Energeniecontrol

Uses the energenie plugs to turn the 3d printer on when octoprint connects, and turn it off when it disconnects.
The control board and sockets can be found here:

The plugin doesn't add any UI to octoprint, it just runs when a user connects or disconnects from the printer using the Connection section in the sidebar.
