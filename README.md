# OctoPrint-Energeniecontrol

Uses the energenie plugs to turn the 3d printer on when octoprint connects, and turn it off when it disconnects.
The control board and two plugs can be found here: https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/product/ENER002-2PI

The plugin doesn't add any UI to octoprint, it just runs when a user connects or disconnects from the printer using the Connection section in the sidebar.
